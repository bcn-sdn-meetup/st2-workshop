It works like a charm with Ansible, Salt and StackStorm (or as a Python library)

## Other projects

**napalm-logs** is a Python library that listens to syslog messages from network devices and returns strucuted data following the OpenConfig or IETF YANG models.

**napalm-yang** YANG (RFC6020) is a data modelling language, itâ€™s a way of defining how data is supposed to look like. The napalm-yang library provides a framework to use models defined with YANG in the context of network management. It provides mechanisms to transform native data/config into YANG and vice versa.
